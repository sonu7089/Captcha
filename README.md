# Spring Boot Captcha Generator and Server Side Verification 

Creating a captcha with Spring Boot is a method used for verifying users in a web application. This process compares the accuracy of the numbers and letters entered by the user with the numbers and letters displayed in an image. This prevents automated bot entries in the application and ensures the security of real users.

To perform captcha generation, there are several libraries available in the Java language. In this article, we will use a library called kaptcha. This library generates captcha images and performs the verification process.
